    "Up to now we have learned how to write a kernel function and how to efficiently run it. Our input data progressed together with our knowledge as we switched from a 1D sampled signal to a 2D image array at the input / output of our kernel. Now it's time to go back to 1D data samples, while still potentially leveraging a 2D grid of threads. We will also look at how we can recycle existing threads and use them in different contexts within the same kernel. However, before we do so there is still one elephant in the room that is keeping our kernel functions from reaching their full potential - memory management."

    "At the end of the third assignment there was a hint regarding the first step of memory management. Calling the statement `cuda.to_device()` enables us to allocate memory on the GPU and enjoy short read/write times, instead of always passing CPU-based arrays to the kernel function. One can think of it as a `malloc()` statement in C, with the host being the GPU's RAM. Judging by the below figure, transferring the entire array only once to and from the GPU is far more efficient than constantly referencing objects in the CPU's working memory. Moreover, if numerous therads access the data bus at the same time, the bus becomes a bottleneck, stalling any processing instructions and increasing the time delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that Numba does implement conservative memory transfers in the background. These take place during kernel invocation, initially transferring memory to the GPU and back to the CPU once the kernel finishes. However, in certain cases it's more rewarding to keep the data on the GPU in between multiple computations.\n",

    "##### I. Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filter\n",
    "1. Designe a GPU kernel funcitons that implements the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. \n",
    "    - Keep speed of execution in mind when designing it (parallel sample access, atomic operations, parallel summation, etc.)\n",
    "    - Test it using the input signal of your liking, and try to adhere to the optimizations we know so far (warp size)\n",
    "2. Time the kernel with and without memory pre-allocation (`cuda.to_device()`). How much time do the two kernels take to execute and how much time is used up for memory migration?\n",
    "3. (optional) Leverage the other memory types on the GPU. What are the gains?\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### II. Including the DFT\n",
    "1. Verify that your DFT code from the first assignment can correctly process the input signal you defined. Change the two if needed.\n",
    "2. Now calculate the DFT of the filtered signal. Do so without migrating the data back to CPU memory in-between the two operations. Instead, keep it in the GPU's memory.\n",
    "3. Additionally calculate the DFT of the filter's input signal, based on the data that has been migrated to the GPU. The program now consists of the functions: DFT-ZK-DFT.\n",
    "4. Discuss the timing results and verify all of the function outputs are correct (DFT and filter).\n",
    "5. Compare the optimal timing results (II. 2.) with a non-optimized version of the code, where data is constantly transfers to and from the CPU. What are the gains?"
